3. [Code structure](#code-structure)


## First time setup

### 1. Forking the repository
If you are planning on contributing to this website (new content for the blog, updates to the existing content, or code improvements,) start by creating a `Fork` of the repository under your own account. The `Fork` button is in the upper-right corner of the repository Github page.

The URL for the forked repository should look like this: `https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/ritughiya.github.io`. Once you have it, clone the repository locally, by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/ritughiya.github.io.git
```

### 2. Getting the development environment set up

Follow the [Jekyll Installation Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) in order to install Jekyll (and the Ruby dev environment) on your computer. 

Navigate to the project's main directory and install its dependencies by running `bundle install`.

You should now be ready to run the site locally. Execute `bundle exec jekyll serve`, and navigate to `127.0.0.1:4000` in your browser.
